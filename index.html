        <p>
          I’m Callum Mountford, a second-year games design and programming student with a creative background in the music industry. While I am still early in my game development journey, I bring with me a strong understanding of the creative process and a drive to keep learning and improving.
I embrace challenges and actively pursue new skills to deliver the best results, like making this website to showcase my work.

          <br><br>
          Here, you can explore some of my game projects built in Unity and Unreal, showcasing my skills in C# and C++.

      <p>Defective is a top-down action game created using Unreal Engine 5 with Blueprint. 
        The visuals draw inspiration from games like “Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart” and “Stray.” 
        This project marked my first experience working with Unreal.
The game's setting is a dystopian construction site where a new city is being built in the 
desert. Players take on the role of a machine that has been liberated from its work protocol, 
aiming to escape while battling security forces.
The focus of the project is on level design, action, and weapon mechanics. The game systems 
evolve as players progress through the levels, featuring pickups and progressively introducing new enemy weapon types.

      <p>AI Behaviour: Using the navmesh system to create areas where the enemies could navigate. For the different enemy types
        there was different behaviour such as a chaser that follows the player, a randomly moving enemy and an enemy that can spawn others. 
      <p>Player Controller: Extended the existing player controller framework by implementing a 
        health and damage system, player death state, and enhanced movement mechanics. 
        Added features such as temporary speed boosts to improve gameplay dynamics and responsiveness</p>
        <img src="Images/Box.png" alt="Niagara Blueprint" />
      <p>Box Explosion: Implemented timed explosive boxes inspired by “Ratchet & Clank”, featuring visual 
        cues and delayed detonation. Utilised the Niagara particle system to create custom explosion effects 
        and flashing indicators, enhancing the game's visual feedback.</p>
      <p>Weapons: Designed a modular weapon architecture using parent classes for both 
        weapons and projectiles. This structure allowed easy creation and extension of weapon 
        types with unique behaviour and stats, such as a high-rate blaster, a powerful slow-firing 
        disk launcher, and a one-shot lightning weapon capable of eliminating weaker enemies.</p>
      <img src="Images/Lava.png" alt="Lava Blueprint" />
      <p>Lava: Created interactive lava pits with delayed damage-over-time effects to add environmental 
        challenge. Integrated collision and timing logic to encourage careful navigation.</p>

      <p>Full Development (Design, Programming, Writing)</p>
      <h3>Time:</h3>
      <p>3 Weeks</p>
      <p>For this prototype, the objective was to create a game 
        within a three-week timeframe that utilizes only one stick 
        and one button for its mechanics. Inspired by the game "Thomas Was Alone," 
        I designed a game featuring two characters, with different jump heights, that the player must switch between 
        to solve the puzzles in each level. Additionally, I included dialogue text to 
        enhance the gameplay experience, providing players with a reason to connect with 
        the two basic shapes as they follow the story of an unlikely friendship.</p>

      <p>Character Swapping: Implemented a flexible character swap system with 
        adjustable parameters for each playable character. Allowed for seamless switching between
        characters during gameplay to solve level-based puzzles. This introduced me to custom movement 
        logic in C#, deepening my understanding of player state management and input handling in Unity.</p>
      <img src="Images/P1Input.png" alt="Input Code" />
      <p>Input Mechanics: Designed a simple yet effective control scheme using a single stick for movement (left, right, jump) and a single 
        button to switch characters. This input design fulfilled the project brief while enhancing 
        gameplay variety through character-specific abilities.</p>
      <img src="Images/P1SceneManage.png" alt="Scene Manager Code" />
      <p>Level Management: Integrated Unity’s SceneManager to handle level transitions. Implemented logic to automatically restart the current level upon 
        failure and load the next level upon completion, creating a smooth gameplay loop and supporting structured level progression</p>

      <p>5 Weeks</p>
      <p>For this prototype, the objective was to create a story-driven game within a 
        five-week timeframe. Drawing inspiration from noir-style narratives and the game 
        “Papers, Please,” I developed quite a fun concept. 
In this game the player must read through various case files to determine whether the suspected 
individual is guilty or innocent. The project focused heavily on narrative design, and I aimed to 
ensure that each case file was varied enough to allow players to make different decisions. The choices 
you make are significant, as the case files you receive on the second day are based on the outcomes of your initial verdicts.

      <p>Scriptable Objects Case Files: Structured all in-game case files using ScriptableObjects to create a modular and easily 
        maintainable data system. This allowed the game to dynamically reference player decisions in code, 
        removing unchosen options and tailoring content to reflect player choices. Enhanced replayability and 
        narrative depth through responsive content filtering.</p>
      <img src="Images/P2UI.png" alt="UI Code" />
      <p>Interactive Desk UI: Developed an interactive UI system where case file objects can be clicked, brought to the foreground, 
        and moved freely around a virtual “desk” environment. Implemented layering logic in code to manage hierarchy order 
        within the Unity Canvas system, enabling interactions such as enlarging selected files for better viewing.</p>
